How to Check if you encounter download aborting error:
------------------------------------------------------
Left mouse click any where in testDL sub in Mod_Bhavcopy module. Run it (F5).
If successful, you must see someFile.zip.
If not successful, I can not help other than asking you to move your working folder to D drive or some place in C drive where permissions to save are not a hindrance.


Feel free to edit it and use it.
